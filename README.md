# CodeXaurA - AI Coding Assistant

## Quick Start

### For Windows Users:
1. Double-click `server.bat` to start the local server
2. Your browser will automatically open to `http://localhost:8000`

1. Open terminal in this folder
2. Run: `python server.py`
3. Open browser to `http://localhost:8000`

## Troubleshooting

If you see CORS errors:
1. Make sure you're using the server (server.bat or server.py)
2. Don't open the HTML file directly in browser
3. Check that port 8000 is available
